# Python Course 2
## Assignment 16
- Working with csv, json, xml files
  Using the CSV or pandas library in Python, you can read, analyze, and do things with CSV files.

  JSON is a format with a dictionary structure. The json library can also be used to read and work with json files.

  Working with data in XML format is a little different than working with data types. You can also use the XML library to work with XML.

  In general, CSV and JSON take over because they can be used directly.
